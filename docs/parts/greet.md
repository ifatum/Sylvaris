# SylGreet

> **Experimental.** Test it on your machine before you depend on it, and keep another way to log in at hand.

A login screen for greetd in the same style as [SylLock](lock.md), on every screen, with what you type mirrored on all of them. The session button in the bottom left (or F2) lists every installed session, such as Hyprland, niri or sway; the up and down arrows pick the user. Type the password and it starts that session, and remembers both for next time.

Turn it on in NixOS:

```nix
imports = [ sylvaris.nixosModules.sylvaris ];
programs.sylvaris.greeter = {
  enable = true;
  user = "you";
  session = "hyprland";
  swayConfig = ''
    output eDP-1 disable
    output DP-1 mode 2560x1440@165Hz position 0 0
    input * xkb_layout pl
  '';
};
```

It runs in a small sway session. `swayConfig` sets up its screens and keyboard, and `environment` adds variables such as `WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS = "1"` for NVIDIA. Its config lives under `/etc/sylvaris-greet`, and reboot and shutdown are one click away.

It always looks like your desktop. Whenever you switch themes, Sylvaris copies the theme, its wallpaper and your avatar to `/var/lib/sylvaris-greet/shared` (`greeterShare` in `config.json`). That folder belongs to the `users` group (`greeter.shareGroup`), and the login screen uses what it finds there the next time it shows. `greeter.wallpaper` pins one image instead.

Without NixOS, [install.md](../install.md#sylgreet-the-login-screen) shows the greetd setup.
