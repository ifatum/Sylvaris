# Compositors

Sylvaris runs on Hyprland (Lua or classic config), niri and sway. Nearly everything works the same on all three. Where a compositor cannot do something, Sylvaris hides the control or says why instead of failing.

## What each compositor supports

This table is generated from `CAPABILITIES` in `shell/lib/wm.mjs`, and a test keeps it in step with the code.

| | Hyprland | niri | sway |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Key bindings from SylSettings applied live | yes | no | yes |
| Window previews in SylSwitch | yes | no | no |
| Minimize by clicking the title in SylBar | yes | no | yes |
| Screenshot of a single window | yes | no | yes |
| Screen zoom in SylAccessibility | yes | no | no |
| Colour filters in SylAccessibility | yes | no | no |
| Performance mode also trims the compositor | yes | no | yes |

Resin Glass blurs behind panels through the `ext-background-effect-v1` protocol when the compositor offers it. Hyprland 0.56 and newer and niri do; sway does not, so panels there are tinted glass without blur.

## Layer rules

Sylvaris animates its own panels, so turn off the compositor's layer animation for them:

```lua
hl.layer_rule({ name = "sylvaris", match = { namespace = "^syl" }, no_anim = true })
```

```ini
layerrule = noanim, ^syl
```

Do not add `blur` or `ignore_alpha` layer rules, and on niri leave out `background-effect { blur true }`. They blur by transparency instead of by shape, which leaves jagged edges around rounded corners.

## One set of window commands

`sylvaris wm` speaks one language to all three, so key bindings and scripts never care which compositor is running.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wm workspace <n\|next\|prev>` | go to a workspace |
| `wm move-to <n\|next\|prev>` | send the focused window to a workspace |
| `wm focus <left\|right\|up\|down>` | move focus |
| `wm move <left\|right\|up\|down>` | move the focused window |
| `wm close`, `wm fullscreen`, `wm float` | act on the focused window |
| `wm minimize`, `wm restore` | park the focused window and bring it back (Hyprland, sway) |
| `wm exec <command>` | run a command |
| `wm reload`, `wm quit` | reload the compositor's config, or leave the session |
| `wm` or `sylvaris state compositor` | workspaces, windows and the focused window as JSON |

The state has the same shape everywhere: each workspace has `index`, `name`, `output`, `active`, `focused`, `urgent` and a window count, read live from Hyprland's and sway's IPC and from niri's event stream. Windows come from the Wayland foreign-toplevel protocol, which all three support.
