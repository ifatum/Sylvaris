### Changed

- Rename SylvarisCC to SylCenter and SylvarisTP to SylTheme

- Center icon-only buttons and workspace numbers, tint app icons with the theme and pass GPU variables to headless runs
- Move each SylSettings page into its own file

### Fixed

- Draw glass grain over the whole shape of round surfaces instead of a square inside them

- Address final review findings
- Open SylvarisCC on the focused output right after startup
- Pause the orbit under the pointer and tell apart close refresh rates
- Let clicks outside SylvarisCC close it on Hyprland
- Smooth shapes and avatar edges, center icon glyphs, animate state changes
- Move the Resin Glass sheen as an item so it repaints
- Show the back card of the SylvarisTP ring and fill the blurred backdrop to the edges
- Cancel SylvarisTP on backdrop taps and step the carousel per wheel notch
- Shape the niri blur to the panel instead of the whole layer surface
- Keep music playing while the equalizer changes and smooth out the whole shell
- Keep blur edges tucked under the glass rim
- Show SylDiver when a timed plan starts and ring only for alarms
- Show the alarm that is ringing when two reminders fire together
- Spread full-screen backgrounds from the edges or the center instead of fading a zoomed copy
